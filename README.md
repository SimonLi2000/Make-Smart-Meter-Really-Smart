# Introducing Edge Intelligence to Smart Meters via Federated Split Learning

This is the codebase for our paper "Introducing Edge Intelligence to Smart Meters via Federated Split Learning".

## Overview

Low-cost smart meters are ubiquitous in smart grids. Enabling resource-constraint smart meters to perform deep learning is quite challenging. Our end-edge-cloud framework reveals a new path for edge intelligence on smart meters. It improves 95.6% memory footprint, 94.8% training time, and 50% communication overhead, achieving comparable or even superior forecasting accuracy to the
resource-unlimited methods. We provide code for established experimental and simulation platforms.

## Dataset

The current version supports the following datasets and tasks are saved in `dataset`:
- BDG2 - Building load forecasting
- CBTs - Residential load forecasting

## Experimental platform

You can build the **experimental platform** with three components: microcontrollers, personal computers and tower server. `experimental_platform` is loaded with the code deployed on them.
> **Note:** The microcontrollers are coded in  **C language** and the computers and tower server are coded in **Python**.

To use the provided code, you are supposed to:
- Compile `experimental_platform/smart_meter/USER/.uvprojx` and download the code to the flash memory of microcontrollers.
- Run `experimental_platform/edge_server/Edge_server` on computers.
- Run `experimental_platform/cloud_server/Cloud_server` on server.
> **Note:** Please ensure the communication network is connected and stable before use.
 
## Simulation platform

You can also build the **simulation platform** with the tower server. `simulation_platform` is loaded with the code deployed on it.

To use the provided code, please run `simulation_platform/Test.py` to obtain results.
