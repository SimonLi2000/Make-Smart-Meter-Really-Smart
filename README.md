# Introducing Edge Intelligence to Smart Meters via Federated Split Learning

This is tge codebase to our paper "Introducing Edge Intelligence to Smart Meters via Federated Split Learning".

## Overview

Low-cost smart meters are ubiquitous in smart grids. Eabling resource-constraint smart meters to perform deep learning is quite challenging. Our end-edge-cloud framework reveal a new path for edge intelligence on smart meters. It improves 95.6% memory footprint, 94.8% training time, and 50% communication overhead and achieves comparable or even superior accuracy. We provide code for established experimental platform and simulation platform.

## Dataset

The current version support the following datasets and tasks are saved in `dataset`:
- BDG2 - Building load forecasting
- CBTs - Residential load forecasting

## Experimental platform

You can build the **experimental platform** with three components: microcontrollers, personal computers and tower server. `experimental_platform` is loaded with the code deployed on them.
> **Note:** The microcontrollers are coded in  **C language** and the computers and tower server are coded in **Python**.

To use the provided code, you are supposed:
- Compile `experimental_platform/smart_meter/USER/.uvprojx` and download the code to flash memory of micorcontrollers.
- Run `experimental_platform/edge_server/Edge_server` on computers.
- Run `experimental_platform/cloud_server/Cloud_server` on server.
> **Note:** Please make sure the communication network is connected and stable before use.
 
## Simulation platform

You also can build the **simulation platform** with tower server. `simulation_platform` is loaded with the code deployed on it.
To use the provided code, please run `simulation_platform/Test.py` to obtain results.

## Requirement

Experimental platform:
- Python 3.6+
- Î¼Vision 5.3+

Simulation platform:
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.4.0+
